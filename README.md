The program includes functionality to download the final internal table data into a local file. Before downloading, header details are appended, and the internal table contents are converted into file-compatible format. The standard SAP function module GUI_DOWNLOAD is used to transfer the internal table data to the local file system. To provide meaningful user feedback, the function module FORMAT_MESSAGE is called to construct the complete message text. In case the download process fails, the system will display the message text “File download failed”, whereas if the process is successful, it will display the message text “File downloaded successfully”. This ensures proper communication of the download status to the end user.
